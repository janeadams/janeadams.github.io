# Jane Adams

Hey, thanks for visiting! Please reach out if you think we could make something cool together :)

## IRL
In my personal time, I enjoy curating and making art. I love rock climbing, taking care of plants, and hiking. I love my partner very much. My favorite video games are Minecraft, Civilization VI, Cities Skylines, and Anno 1800. I am very slowly researching and writing a book about realism techniques in paintings c.1700-1900, and exploring the use of L systems for data art. I'm a moderator of datavis.social, a Mastodon instance in the fediverse.

## RESEARCH

I’m presently a rising 4th-year Computer Science PhD student in the [Data Visualization Lab at Northeastern University’s Khoury College](https://vis.khoury.northeastern.edu/), under the advisement of [Dr. Michelle Borkin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m9F7mIgAAAAJ&hl=en), and also completing coursework in the College of Science for a graduate certificate in Bioinformatics. This past year, I worked on developing longitudinal lab analysis tools for liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry ([LC/MS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_chromatography%E2%80%93mass_spectrometry)) with [Agilent Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agilent_Technologies). My research interest, broadly, is visualization for exploratory analysis of high-dimensional data (yes, I would love to talk with you about non-linear projection methods over coffee). [Book a meeting with me here!](https://janeadams.youcanbook.me/)

My favorite language is Python, and some of my favorite libraries are NetworkX, Plotly, SciKit Learn, and Pandas. I usually work in Python, [D3](https://d3js.org/)/JS, [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), and full stack web development (esp. [MERN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(solution_stack))). I have experience with [HPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing)/[Slurm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurm_Workload_Manager), building [Flask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_(web_framework)) APIs, [React](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(software)) dashboards, [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Platform) for scientific computing, [BigQuery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigQuery), [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)), [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth)/MFA, and [BitBucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitbucket) and [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) CI/CD pipelines. Sometimes I dabble in Java and C++ for art projects, or use R for statistics. I'm in the process of learning TypeScript. Some Python libraries I've been learning to use lately are LangChain/LangGraph, ChromaDB, and CuGraph (a CUDA wrapper for NetworkX to make toposort go brrrr).

I’ve been a speaker and panelist at [NVIDIA GTC](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcspring22-s41450/), [SXSW 2022](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2022/events/PP117091) & [2023](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2023/events/PP123318), [TEDx](https://www.ted.com/talks/jane_adams_data_art_an_emerging_complement_to_data_science), [AIGA](https://www.facebook.com/events/maglianero/design-wtf-06-whats-a-data-artist-with-jane-adams/239586106926567/), ODSC [East](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fu0xqGj0Sjk) and [West](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQYMiIAr5Io), [IEEE VIS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/561962341709260), and [AAAI](https://creativeai-ws.github.io/). I’ve organized workshops at [WiDS Stanford](https://www.widsworldwide.org/), and IEEE VIS [2020](https://failfest.github.io/), [2021](https://altvis.github.io/2021.html), [2022](https://altvis.github.io/2022.html), and [2023](https://altvis.github.io/). I have published work in [TVCG](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/561962341709260), [Science Advances](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abe6534), [PLoS](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0279225), [EPJ Data Science](https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-021-00271-0), [JMIR](https://mental.jmir.org/2022/3/e33685), [JMM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Mathematics_Meetings) and more.
