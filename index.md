# ABOUT ME

## RIGHT NOW

I’m presently a Computer Science PhD student in the Data Visualization Lab at Northeastern University’s Khoury College, under the advisement of Dr. Michelle Borkin, and also completing coursework in the College of Science for a graduate certificate in Bioinformatics. I just finished all my course requirements for candidacy and a MS in Computer Science! Last summer, I worked on exploratory analysis tools for systems genetics research with The Jackson Laboratory (“JAX”). This fall, I’m pivoting towards situated visualization for embedded systems for liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry with Agilent Technologies. My research interest, broadly, is visualization for exploratory analysis of high-dimensional data (yes, I would love to talk with you about non-linear projection methods over coffee). Book a meeting with me here!

I usually work in Python, D3/JS, and full stack MERN web development. My visualization library of choice is Plotly. I am excited about Vega / Altair. I have mixed emotions about d3 after living through the harrowing backwards compatibility incongruencies of v4 / v5 – trying to ease my code trauma so I can really explore the new d3 + Svelte pairing. Generally, I think visualization principles should be taught in a language-agnostic way, with a focus on forming a strong mental model for encodings and human-in-the-loop task analysis driven development. This past summer I worked with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for scientific computing, and tools like BigQuery, Docker, OAuth, and BitBucket CI/CD pipelines. I’ve built Flask APIs for production, and modular multi-paged React dashboards for bespoke visualizations. I’m familiar with High Performance Computing (HPC) protocols including Slurm / job queues and parallelizing my code. Sometimes I also dabble in Java and C++ for art projects, or write R code to help out folks who really love statistics.

Beginning in 2020, I really enjoyed experimenting with training my own generative adversarial networks (GANs) as an art medium using Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow) on Google Colab GPUs, which I spoke about at NVIDIA GTC as a featured speaker and later as a panelist. However, for now, I’m hunkering down a bit to learn Blender — I’m particularly intrigued by Geometry Nodes and custom Python scripting with shaders.

I’ve been a speaker at NVIDIA GTC, SXSW 2022 & 2023, TEDx, AIGA, ODSC, IEEE VIS, and AAAI. I’ve organized workshops at WiDS Stanford, and IEEE VIS 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. I have published work in Science Advances, PLoS, EPJ Data Science, JMIR, JMM and more.

## IRL

In my personal time, I build art robots, interactive mixed-media installations, aquaponic sculptures, and GAN art. I love rock climbing, hiking, Minecraft, Civilization VI, City Skylines, and tinkering with MIDI music. I’m looking for a gallery to represent my artwork, so please reach out if you are a curator, especially working in new media.
