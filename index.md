## RIGHT NOW

I’m presently a Computer Science PhD student in the Data Visualization Lab at Northeastern University’s Khoury College, under the advisement of Dr. Michelle Borkin, and also completing coursework in the College of Science for a graduate certificate in Bioinformatics. I just finished all my course requirements for candidacy and a MS in Computer Science! This year, I’m working on longitudinal lab analysis tools for liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC/MS) with Agilent Technologies. My research interest, broadly, is visualization for exploratory analysis of high-dimensional data (yes, I would love to talk with you about non-linear projection methods over coffee). [Book a meeting with me here!](https://janeadams.youcanbook.me/)

My favorite language is Python. I usually work in Python, D3/JS, and full stack MERN web development; I want to learn Svelte. I have experience with HPC/Slurm, building Flask APIs, React dashboards, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for scientific computing, BigQuery, Docker, OAuth, and BitBucket CI/CD pipelines. Sometimes I dabble in Java and C++ for art projects, or use R for statistics.

I’ve been a speaker at NVIDIA GTC, SXSW 2022 & 2023, TEDx, AIGA, ODSC, IEEE VIS, and AAAI. I’ve organized workshops at WiDS Stanford, and IEEE VIS 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. I have published work in TVCG, Science Advances, PLoS, EPJ Data Science, JMIR, JMM and more. You can find my [Google Scholar profile here](https://scholar.google.com/).

## IRL
In my personal time, I enjoy curating and making art. I love rock climbing, taking care of plants, and hiking. My favorite video games are Minecraft, Civilization VI, Cities Skylines, and Anno 1800.
